# Week-1-challenge

For my first bootcamp homework assignment, the challenge was to refactor a HTML code with semantic mark-ups. Along with refining the style sheet with grouping redundant codes. The purpose of semantic HTML is to bring clarirty to both the browser and the developer. Better accessibility is also another benefit of using semantic elements. Various technologies (screen readers for sight impairment) are able to better understand the context and content of websites when you are using proper semantic mark-ups. End result is a better experience for users.

I was given the task to refactor multi-media marketing company Horiseon's homepage without changing the layout of the page. Although the webpage is fabolusely put together, once I dived into the HTML the lack of clarity was apparent. 

<div> tags were replaced with the correct elements to section the webpage properly. Within the CSS sheet you will find remarks in regards to the editing and consolodation that was done. Reworking both the HTML and CSS page, Horiseon's webpage has remained in original form. Within my repository you will find the revised HTML, and CSS.
